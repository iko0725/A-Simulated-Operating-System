# A Simulated Operating System

The project implemented a software application that simulates some basic functions of a real OS by using C++ languages and Qt widget tools. It simulates the memory allocation, file system, task scheduling, and error system and includes the functions of booting up, login in, users' accounts, calendar, calculator, text editor, memo, media player, video game, browser, camera, painter and photo. Moreover, it enables users to check the real-time condition of CPU and storage in the monitor.
